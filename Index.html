    <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone and welcome to my site! My name is Christopher Northrup and I am a software developer from Upstate New York.</p>

        <h2>About Christopher</h2>
        <p>I graduated from North Carolina State University with a degree in Spanish language and literature. I also received a master’s degree in education. After several years of working as a teacher, I realized that it was not my passion. Even though it was not the right fit for me, I believe my years as a teacher helped prepare me for a career in software development. During the course of my career as a teacher, I frequently had to work as part of a team. Now, teamwork is something to which I am accustomed and I enjoy. When I stopped teaching, I began traveling around the world and I started building my travel blog. I realized that I was very limited by the plugins that websites like WordPress provided and I wanted to be able to take my project to the next level. I have loved it so much that I want to make programming into my full-time career. 
            While programming has become a more recent passion of mine, my other interests include:</p>
